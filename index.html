      <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and 
        prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share 
        documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based 
        hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and 
        server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems 
        engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but 
        the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] 
        from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is 
        used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>
      <p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called 
        "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 
        1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively 
        simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly 
        influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language 
        (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still 
        exist in HTML 4.</p>

        <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language 
          for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be 
          assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and 
          scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

      <section class="grid_4">
        <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local 
          storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes 
          the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for 
          the appearance of the document.</p>

      <section class="grid_4">
        <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
           images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the 
           rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by 
           denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, 
           links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written 
           using angle brackets.</p>

                  HTML5 was published as a Working Draft by the W3C.
                  Although its syntax closely resembles that of SGML, HTML5 has abandoned any attempt to be an SGML application and has explicitly defined its own "html" serialization, in addition to an alternative XML-based XHTML5 serialization.</p>

                  On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.[47] In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless continues its project to release HTML5.</p>

                  In September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.[52]
                  On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation,[53] meaning the specification process is complete.</p>
